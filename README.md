# Cucumber Coverage

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sysen-limited/grunt-cucumber-coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sysen-limited/grunt-cucumber-coverage)

Coverage reporting for Node projects using Cucumber with Grunt.

This project is aimed at those using Cucumber to execute tests and need to gain coverage information,
while coverage reporters are available for use with tools like Selenium and Protractor this is aimed at those running Node tests without a browser.
Both ES5 and ES6 code bases have been tested to ensure current practices are supported.

Runs your tests by executing feature files with [cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) and gathers coverage information of source code with [istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul).

## Getting Started

Get the project as a dependency;

```
npm install --save-dev grunt-cucumber-coverage
```

Add the task to your gruntfile script;

```
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-cucumber-coverage');
```

> Tip:  
> We recommend when using grunt to use the project [load-grunt-tasks](https://www.github.com/sindresorhus/load-grunt-tasks) to simplify your inclusion of grunt task dependencies.

## Usage Examples

```
cucumber_coverage: {
    example: {
        src: 'example/features',
        options: {
            coverage: 'example/src',
            check: {
                lines: 100,
                statements: 100,
                functions: 100,
                branches: 100
            },
            steps: 'example/features/step_definitions',
            tags: '~@Ignore'
        }
    }
}

grunt.registerTask('test', ['cucumber_coverage']);
```

> Note:  
> The **src** value should be set to the location of your cucumber / feature files.

## Options

### options.check
This enables coverage checking of thresholds, if set to true then default values are used.

Type: `Object` or `Boolean`
Default: `false`

| key | default |
| :--- | :--- |
| lines | 80 |
| statements | 80 |
| functions | 80 |
| branches | 80 |

This equates to the `--lines` `--statements` `--functions` `--branches` options for istanbul check-coverage

> Hint:  
> You can also change just individual keys if required and defaults will be used for others.

> Note:  
> The default **false** value will mean that coverage levels are not checked and low coverage will not result in a grunt error.

### options.coverage
This is the source code folder for which coverage reporting will be made.

Type: `String`  
Default: `null`

This equates to the `--root` option for istanbul cover

### options.steps
Specify where step definitions are located from project root directory

Type: `String`  
Default: `<src>/step_definitions`

This equates to the `--require` option for cucumber

### options.tags
Run just a specific tag or tags for a feature file set

Type: `String` or `Array`  
Default: `null`

This equates to the `--tags` option for cucumber

> Hint:  
> Run just one tag `@tag`  
> Run several tags `@tag,@special`  
> Exclude a tag `~@ignore`  
> Run a mix `['@tag,@special', '~@ignore']`
