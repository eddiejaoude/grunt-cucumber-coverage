# Cucumber Coverage

Coverage reporting for cucumber with grunt.

This project is aimed at those using cucumber to execute tests and need to gain coverage information,
while coverage reporters are available for use with tools like selenium and protractor this is aimed at those running tests from the command line.

Configure your tests to execute with cucumber and instrument source code with istanbul to gather coverage information.

This project is aimed to work with both ES5 and ES6 source code projects.

## Getting Started

Get the project as a dependency;

```
npm install --save-dev grunt-cucumber-coverage
```

Add the task to your gruntfile script;

```
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-cucumber-coverage');
```

> Tip: We recommend when using grunt to use the project [load-grunt-tasks](https://www.github.com/sindresorhus/load-grunt-tasks) to simplify your inclusion of grunt task dependencies.

## Usage Examples

```
cucumber_coverage: {
    example: {
        files: {
            cwd: 'example/features',
            src: '**/*.feature'
        },
        options: {
            coverage: 'example/src',
            check: {
                lines: 100,
                statements: 100,
                functions: 100,
                branches: 100
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> Note: The **files** value should be set to the location of your feature files that will be executed using the [grunt.file.expand](http://gruntjs.com/api/grunt.file#globbing-patterns) format for pattern globbing.

## Options

### options.coverage
This is the source code folder for which coverage reporting will be made.

Type: `String`

Default: `null`

### options.check
This enables coverage checking of thresholds, if set to true then default values are used.

Type: `Object` or `Boolean`

Default: `false`

| key | default |
| :--- | :--- |
| lines | 80 |
| statements | 80 |
| functions | 80 |
| branches | 80 |

> Hint: You can also change just individual keys if required and defaults will be used for others.

> Note: The default *false* value will mean that coverage levels are not checked and low coverage will not result in a grunt error.
